# Codecademy - Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts project

## Overview
This is my solution to the Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts project challenge that can be found on the [Front-End Engineer path from Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/journeys/front-end-engineer/paths/fecj-22-web-development-foundations/tracks/fecj-22-fundamentals-of-html/modules/wdcp-22-learn-html-structure-a9e15f23-fbb3-4054-9b03-a56c91068d52/projects/html-fashion-blog). 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned
I continue to cement HTML5 and CSS3 skills.

### Continued development
I would love to come back to this project and give it a completely different design. That way, I can develop my design AND programming skills.
